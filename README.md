# Perceptron Demo

This is a demo project describing how perceptron in neural networks is working.
This project is written in react and typescript

What is this demo doing:
There are many point on the canvas. Some of them have positive value and some negative.
Value depends whether a point is above or below a yellow random line crossing the canvas.

We are going to train a perceptron to find out when the value of the point is positive and when not. Points at the begining are grey. 
When perceptron correctly finds out that point had positive value, then the color of the point will be green.
When the perceptring finds out that the point has a negative value,then the color will be red.  
Black line is showing what perceptron thinks (that where could be the yellow line).
Training will last 10 seconds

How to run the demo:
- download project
- run npm install 
- run npm start
- open your browser at http://localhost:3000
