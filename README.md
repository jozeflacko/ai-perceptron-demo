# Perceptron Demo

This is a demo project describing how perceptron in Neural Networks works.
This project is written in React and TypeScript

What is this demo doing:
There are many points on the canvas. Some of them have positive value and some negative value.
Value of each perceptron depends whether its position is above or below a yellow line.

We are going to train exactly 1 perceptron for about 10 seconds. Task of this perceptron is to find whether point has positive or negative value. Points at the begining are grey. 
When perceptron correctly finds out that point has positive value, color of the point will change to green.
When the perceptron finds out that the point has a negative value, color of the point will change to red.  
Black line is describes what perceptron thinks (where could be the yellow line).

How to run the demo:
- download project
- run npm install 
- run npm start
- open your browser at http://localhost:3000
