# Perceptron Demo

This is a demo project describing how perceptron in neural networks is working.
This project is written in react and typescript

What is this demo doing:
On canvas I print many points and 1 yellow line. Some of them have a positive value and some negative. It depends whether a point is above a random line in the canvas or not. Percepron is going to be trained and it will find a rule when the point value is positive or negative.

How to run the demo:
- download project
- run npm install 
- run npm start
- open your browser at http://localhost:3000
