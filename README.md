# Perceptron Demo

## This is a demo project describing how perceptron in Neural Networks works.

### This project is written in React and TypeScript

### What is this demo doing:

There are many points on the canvas. Some of them have positive value and some negative value.
Value of each perceptron depends whether its position is above or below a yellow line.

We are going to train exactly 1 perceptron for about 10 seconds. 
Task of this perceptron is to find whether point has positive or negative value. 
- Initially points have all grey color.
- When perceptron correctly finds that point has positive value, color of the point will change to green.
- When the perceptron finds that the point has a negative value, color of the point will change to red.

Black line will describe what perceptron thinks (where could be the yellow line). Click start button to begin the training

### How to run the demo:
- download project
- run npm install 
- run npm start
- open your browser at http://localhost:3000
