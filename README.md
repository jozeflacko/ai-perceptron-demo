# Perceptron Demo

This is a demo project describing how perceptron in Neural Networks works.It it made in TypeScript (JavaScript) language

## Getting Started

You can try it out here: <a href='http://perceptron-demo.jozeflacko.com'>perceptron-demo.jozeflacko.com</a>

* This app is hosted at heroku cloud platform and it can take up to 10 seconds to wake up this page :)

### What is this demo doing:

There are many points on the canvas. Some of them have positive value and some negative value.
Value of each perceptron depends whether its position is above or below a yellow line.

We are going to train exactly 1 perceptron for about 10 seconds. 
Task of this perceptron is to find whether point has positive or negative value. 

* Initially points have all grey color.
* When perceptron correctly finds that point has positive value, color of the point will change to green.
* When the perceptron finds that the point has a negative value, color of the point will change to red.

Black line will describe what perceptron thinks (where could be the yellow line). Click start button to begin the training

### How to run this project locally:

* download project
* run npm install 
* run npm start
* open your browser at http://localhost:3000
